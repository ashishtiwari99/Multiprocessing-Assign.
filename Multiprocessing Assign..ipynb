    "#Multiprocessing in Python-Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. The operating system can then allocate all these threads or processes to the processor to run them parallelly, thus improving the overall performance and efficiency.\n",

    "#Why Use Multiprocessing In Python-Performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging. As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going. Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance."

    "#The deployment of two or even more central processing units throughout a processor system is known as multiprocessing. The systemâ€™s functionality could be considerably improved by multiprocessing. Python only utilizes one central processing unit because of GIL. Unlike C language or Java language, which instantly employ multiprocessing. It is a plug that only enables one process to run simultaneously. The multiprocessing package in Python, therefore, may address that issue. There are two modes in this unit which include Process and the Pool. These can help us execute a specific chunk of code concurrently.\n",
